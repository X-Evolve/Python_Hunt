          <p class="lead mb-4">In the early days of the web, dynamic web pages were created using languages like Perl and CGI scripts. However, as web applications grew in complexity, the need for more structured and powerful languages became apparent.Python emerged as a formidable contender for web development due to its simplicity, readability, and extensive standard library. With the advent of frameworks like Django and Flask in the early 2000s, Python gained significant traction in web development.

            <h2>Server-Side Scripting</h2>
            <p>Python is commonly used for server-side scripting, where it generates dynamic content on the server before sending it to the client's web browser. This is achieved by embedding Python code within HTML files using frameworks like Django, Flask, or Pyramid.</p>

            <h2>Integration with HTML and CSS</h2>
            <p>Python frameworks often incorporate templating engines like Jinja2 or Django templates. These allow developers to separate HTML/CSS templates from Python logic, enhancing code maintainability and readability.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
          <p class="lead mb-4">While Python is not inherently a markup or styling language, its versatility and simplicity have made it an invaluable tool in web development. Through server-side scripting, templating engines, and automation, Python seamlessly integrates with HTML and CSS to create dynamic and visually appealing web applications. This convergence of technologies has contributed to the continued success and popularity of Python in the ever-evolving landscape of web development.</p>
