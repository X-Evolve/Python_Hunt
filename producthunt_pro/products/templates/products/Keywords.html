        <div class="details">Keywords are reserved identifiers that
            have special meanings and functionalities within the Python
            programming language. These keywords cannot be used as variable
            names or identifiers in your program. They are fundamental
            building blocks that define the language's syntax and
            structure.Understanding and using these keywords correctly is
            essential for effective programming and enables developers to
            create efficient, organized, and maintainable code. Python keywords
            are listed below</div>

                            If a given condition is false then python returns
                            False.Python uses False, not false to define falsy
                            values.

                            just means nothing is there.
                            None is also the default return value of a function
                            in python. This means if a function doesn't return
                            any value then it returns None.</td>

                            condition to check. If the first condition is false,

                            It is the final block of code that will definitely

                            python, which is the most used loop in python
                            programming.
                            A loop is used to execute a set of statements
                            multiple times. Suppose you want to print the
                            numbers from 1 to 100. Then you are not going to
                            print for individual number, but just start a loop
                            and it will do the same.</td>

                        <td>while</td>
                        <td>The while keyword is used to create a while loop in
                            python. While loop is used when you don't know the
                            number of iteration you need to perform but you know
                            the condition that will be true for a given number
                            of times.
                            For each iteration of the while loop, you check for
                            a condition if the condition is true then execute
                            the block of code otherwise terminate the loop.</td>

                        <td>break</td>
                        <td>The break keyword has a very significant role in
                            loops. It is used to terminate the loop when a
                            condition is met.
                            Think of an example where you want to add the first
                            100 numbers but want to stop the loop when the sum
                            is greater than 1000. In this case, you can use
                            break keyword to stop the loop by creating a
                            condition.</td>

                            iteration and continue with the next iteration.

                            python which is not readily available.
                            Once you import a module in your code then you can
                            use the features of that module in your code.</td>

                            module, it only imports specific features from a
                            module.
                            Once you import a specific feature you can directly
                            use it without referring to the module name.</td>

                            feature.
                            Renaming of modules is so frequent in python that
                            there are some community standard names for modules.
                            example pandas as pd, numpy as np, matplotlib as

                            a specific task. It is also known as a subroutine.
                            In python, a function is defined using the def
                            keyword.
                            The def keyword is followed by the name of the
                            function and then the parentheses ().
                            The code inside the parentheses is the block of code
                            that is executed when the function is called.
                            The code inside the parentheses can have any number
                            of arguments and can have any number of statements.</td>

                            when a statement is required syntactically but the

                            function in python.
                            A lambda function is a small anonymous function. It
                            can take any number of arguments but can only have
                            one expression. The expression is executed and the
                            result is returned.
                            You can use a lambda function to pass a simple

                            The return keyword is followed by the value that is
                            to be returned from the function or method. Whenever
                            a function or method encounters the return keyword,

                            to the global keyword. nonlocal is used to
                            declare that a variable inside a nested function
                            (function inside a function) is not local to it,
                            meaning it lies in the outer inclosing function.
                            If we need to modify the value of a non-local
                            variable inside a nested function, then we must
                            declare it with nonlocal. Otherwise a local
                            variable with that name is created inside the
                            nested function</td>

                            While programming, sometimes we wish to know the
                            internal state or check if our assumptions are
                            true. assert helps us do this and find bugs more
                            conveniently. assert is followed by a condition.
                            If the condition is true, nothing happens. But
                            if the condition is false, AssertionError is
                            raised.</td>

                            the function until an awaitable (typically a
                            coroutine) is completed and the result is ready.
                            It's an essential part of asynchronous
                            programming in Python and is often used with
                            async functions.</td>

                            coroutines. Asynchronous functions allow you to
                            perform non-blocking operations, which is
                            crucial for I/O-bound or concurrent operations,
                            like network requests or reading from a file.</td>
